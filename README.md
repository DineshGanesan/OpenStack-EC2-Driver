# ThoughtWorks OpenStack to EC2 Driver

Enjoy the benifits of the private cloud while also not being limited by it. 
Just like the present drivers let you leverage the various bankends like VMWare and Xen, this driver will let you use the public cloud to burst your cloud to. For now we are focusing on being able to burst to Amazon EC2.

Using the native OpenStack Dashboard or APIs you would be able to manage the EC2 cloud. 

## Getting Started

* OpenStack Icehouse
* Python 2.7 and above
* Amazon Web Service (AWS) SDK for Python --  Boto 2.31.1
